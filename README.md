File: [data/data.xlsx](data/data.xlsx)

-   Description: This dataset contains performance metrics and assessments related to the application of Stary and WordGen into 06 schools in Brazil, located in Sao Sebatian - Alagoas (Brazil). The data includes demographic details such as age, gender, and location (urban/rural), as well as test scores in subjects such as mathematics and vocabulary, with pre- and post-intervention analysis.

-   Structure: The dataset is structured into several sheets, each focusing on different performance areas (e.g., vocabulary, mathematics, reading). Each sheet tracks data on an individual student level.

-   Key Fields: Details of all fields are located in the Sheet "legend". Some main key fields are

    -   `escola`: School identification.
    -   `id`: Student identification.
    -   `genero`: Gender of the student.
    -   `idade`: Age of the student.
    -   `zona.participante`: Indicates whether the student is from an urban or rural area.
